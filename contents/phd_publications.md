    **Abstract:** Comprehending user behavior on e-commerce platforms is essential for augmenting customer interaction and refining recommendation algorithms. Clickstream data provides a significant resource for examining user navigation patterns; nevertheless, accurately describing and categorizing user sessions poses a challenge. This paper shows how to improve the accuracy of session-based classification using an embedding-based method combined with an aging-based weighting mechanism. We investigate three embedding methods, Word2Vec, Node2Vec, and LSTM Autoencoder that can turn session-based clickstream data into numbers. Furthermore, we present a dynamic weighting technique that emphasizes recent interactions to improve classification performance. Our empirical assessment on an authentic e-commerce dataset reveals that the LSTM Autoencoder surpasses conventional embedding methods in capturing sequential dependencies. Moreover, the age-based weighting technique markedly enhances classification accuracy, especially when used with deep learning models. A study that compares different classification algorithms, like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and LSTM, shows that LSTM models are the best at finding correlations between events over time. The results also show the importance of temporal weighting in session-based clickstream analysis, and they provide a solid foundation for further research in behavioral analytics and personalized recommendation systems. This paper introduces the area by introducing an efficient method for clickstream-based user modeling, facilitating improved user engagement in e-commerce systems.

   **Abstract:** 
    Context
    With the rapid increase in data complexity and volume, analyzing and understanding large-scale datasets has become a critical challenge, especially in domains like e-commerce. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a novel business process that utilizes an event frequency-inverse session frequency (EF-ISF) based weighting mechanism for embedding user navigational behavior in e-commerce websites.
    Objective
    The primary research problem tackled in this study is the detection of patterns and distributions within user behavior data, which is often complicated by dynamic page content and session sparsity. We aim to enhance the interpretability and accuracy of user behavior analysis by integrating EF-ISF with various embedding techniques, including Word2Vec, Node2Vec, DeepWalk, Struc2Vec, and LSTM Autoencoder.
    Methodology
    Our approach is particularly effective in datasets where page refreshes lead to event repetitions, where sequential events with temporal dependencies are prevalent, and where event distributions across sessions are sparse. By applying this methodology across multiple e-commerce datasets, we observe consistent performance in clustering quality, successfully detecting underlying patterns and groups within the data.
    Results
    A prototype implementation demonstrates the practical utility of the proposed method, with evaluation metrics confirming that EF-ISF weighting not only enhances the embeddings but also facilitates a more nuanced and significant segmentation of users' browsing behaviors.
    Conclusion
    These findings provide a valuable contribution to the field of e-commerce data analytics, offering businesses a refined approach to optimizing user experience and engagement through a deeper understanding of user behavior patterns. This methodology can significantly improve the quality of insights derived from user behavior data, ultimately leading to better decision-making and enhanced user satisfaction.

    **Abstract:** Nowadays, the number of people using the internet online increases day by day. Therefore, there is a growing need to analyze user behavior trends using navigational clickstream data these days. User behavior can be defined as the collection of the user’s click sequence and transition movements between pages within site. Application areas of user behavior play an important role in many areas, from e-commerce to the banking sector. User behavior is a good argument for analyzing users’ interests. Although there are many research studies in the literature related to user behavior mining, we could not identify a comprehensive literature review on this topic. This paper gives a systematic map of the analysis and mining of web domain users’ activity in this research. We give exact user behavior measures, and publications that we anticipate will help other researchers discover study gaps and possibilities in this paper.
